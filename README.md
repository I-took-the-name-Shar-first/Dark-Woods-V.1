# Dark-Woods-V.1
Shar/4's first mod for Cataclyzem TLG


Feralite: Lost and Dammed
(Parent mod named by friend)

A big thank you to my close friends who encouraged me to stick with this wonderfully silly idea, Wormgirl, for creating the game that is teaching me how to code, the larger Cataclysm community as a whole and all of the developers and contributors to it's many and varied forks, and the creators and maintainers of the mod's My Sweet Cataclysm, Arcana, and Mind over Matter to pushing me in the right direction.

This thank you will grow with time, and it will not be easily forgotten.
